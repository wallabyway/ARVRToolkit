# Update 1 (Nov17)

#### New:
- The project assets are now packaged as a .unityproject bundle, which you can install by choosing `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package` from the main menu of the Unity editor.
- The project assets now include sample scenes that illustrate different ways of setting up the ForgeLoader script component. You can find them under `Assets > Forge` Samples.
For details on these sample scenes, see the Get started with the Forge to Unity data pipeline page.
- The ForgeLoader script component has a new `UnityEvent` that reports the completion percentage of its current download task, and that fires an event when the model is fully downloaded. You can use these triggers to drive a UI element such as a progress bar. (For an example, see the new `sample scenes`.)
- You can now import Forge assets into the Unity editor and save them to prefabs, instead of having your app download them at runtime. Select `Forge > Import Scene` in the main menu of the Unity editor.

#### Bug fixes:
- Redefines the upVector based on metadata - the previous version always assumed a Z up vector, whereas Unity uses Y.
- Malformed mesh UVs were causing issues in the Unity engine.
- An HTTP error on getting the `instanceTree` could cause multiple scene objects to be created.
- WSA support was missing `#using` directives.
- Malformed Metadata (`ForgeProperties`) were not displayed properly in the Unity Editor.
